# Get Started

> Re-usable components built with Radix Vue, and Tailwind CSS.

This project takes some components from the shadcn-vue repository, which is itself a port of shadcn-ui to Vue. This is a customized version with ui and ux that differs slightly from the vue port and consequently also from the original shadcn ui project.

This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can import with the CLI to add to your apps.

What do you mean not a component library?

Pick the components you need. Use the CLI to automatically add the components into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.

## Typescript

This project and the components are written in TypeScript. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.
